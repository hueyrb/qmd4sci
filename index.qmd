# About this {-}

This is a book on quarto and aimed for scientists interested in reproducibility. It was initially developed as a 3-hour workshop, "Rmarkdown for scientists" and then formulated as an open-access book. It has been updated to use quarto, which is a more updated and modern take on rmarkdown. It now serves as an introductory resource that will grow and change over time as a **living book**.

This book aims to teach the following:

- Getting started with your own quarto document
  - Using RStudio
  - Visual Studio Code
- Improve workflow:
  - RStudio
    - Demonstrate rstudio projects
    - Using keyboard shortcuts
  - Quarto projects
- Export your quarto documents to PDF, HTML, and Microsoft Word
- Manage figures and tables
    - Reference figures and tables in text so that they dynamically update if the data change
    - Create captions for figures and tables
    - Change the size, resolution, and type of figures
    - Save the figures to disk when rendering a document
- Work with equations
    - Inline and display
    - Caption equations
    - Reference equations
- Manage bibliographies
  - Cite articles in text
  - Generate bibliographies
  - Change bibliography styles
- Debug and handle common errors with quarto
- Next steps in working with quarto:
  - How to extend yourself to other formats, such as slides, websites, books, and more

## Why write this as a book?

This book started out its first life covering rmarkdown. Many great books cover R Markdown and it's various features, such as ["Rmarkdown: The definitive guide"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/), ["bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), and ["Dynamic Documents with R and knitr, Second edition"](https://www.crcpress.com/Dynamic-Documents-with-R-and-knitr/Xie/p/book/9781498716963), and Yihui Xie's thesis, ["Dynamic Graphics and Reporting for Statistics"](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/13518/).

With the [release of quarto](), I wanted to translate the materials I developed in "Rmarkdown for scientists" into Quarto.  Other excellent resources for learning quarto include: 

- [The quarto "get started" guide](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)
- [The quarto guide "quarto manuscripts"](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/)
- [The quarto chapter in "R for data science"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto)
- [Making shareable documents with quarto from](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/), from OpenScapes
- [Alison Hill's blog post: "we don't talk about quarto"](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/)
- [Mine Ã‡entinkaya-Rundel's talk "Quarto for academics"](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2023-05-22-quarto-for-academics/)

The quarto guide (above) is extensive, and indeed this present book overlaps with "quarto manuscripts" guide. 

> So, why write a book?

Good question. The answer is that the structure of a book also serves as a framework for am introductory workshop, even one scheduled for only a few hours. It is not to say that there aren't already great resources out there; there are. It is instead adding to the list of other useful information out there on the internet. I considered the Rmarkdown for Scientsts book and course a success, and it helped me and others understand and better use rmarkdown. So I guess, to answer a question with another question:

> Why NOT write this as a book?

## How to use this book

This book was written to provide course materials for a 3-hour course on Quarto

The following sections of the book can be worked through in 3 hours:

- [Why use Quarto](why-qmd)
- [Installation](installation)
- [what is RStudio?](rstudio)
- [suggested workflow and hygiene](workflow)
- [how to use R Markdown](using-rmd)
- [using R Markdown with pdf, html, and Word](pdf-html-word)
- [what are some useful keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts)
- [Adding captions to tables and figures](figures-tables-captions)
- [Changing figures](changing-figures)
- [Adding mathematics](math)
- [Citing figures and tables](cite-fig-tab-sec)
- [Changing citations and styles](citations-and-styles)

The remaining sections can be used as extra material for self study, or to extend the workship:

- [Fixing some common problems in R Markdown](common-problems)
- [What are some alternative outputs of R Markdown?](alternative-outputs-and-exts)
- [Where to go next?](next-steps)
- [Suggested references](references)

Course materials can be downloaded by using the following command from the `usethis` package:

```{r}
#| label: use-course
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
usethis::use_course("bit.ly/qmd4sci-materials")
```
